# Because He lives
```
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know-w-w He holds the future
And life is worth a living, just because He lives

God sent His son, they called Him Jesus He came to love, heal and forgive
He lived and died to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know-w-w He holds the future
And life is worth a living, just because He lives

And then one day, I'll cross the river
I'll fight life's final war with pain
And then as death gives way to victory
Iâ€™ll see the lights of glory and l'll know He reigns

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know-w-w He holds the future
And life is worth a living, just because He lives
