# I will sing of the mercices
```
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever
I will sing, I will sing
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.

With my mouth will I make known
Thy faithfulness, thy faithfulness
With my mouth will I make known
Thy faithfulness to all generations.
