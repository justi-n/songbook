# Blest are You Lord
```
Blest are You, Lord, God of all creation
Thanks to Your goodness,
this bread we offer
Fruit of the earth, work of our hands
It will become the bread of life.
Blessed be God (2)
blessed be God for ever, amen
Blessed be God (2)
blessed be God for ever, amen
Blest are You, Lord God of all creation
Thanks to Your goodness
this wine we offer
Fruit of the vine, work of our hands
It will become the cup of joy.
