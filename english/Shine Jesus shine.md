# Shine Jesus shine
```
Lord the light of your Love is shining
In the midst of the darkness shining
Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us
Set us free by the truth you now bring us
Shine on me (2).

Shine Jesus shine,
fill this land with
The Father's glory
Blaze spirit blaze,
set our heart on fire
Flow river flow;
flood the nations with Grace and mercy
Send forth your word,
Lord let there be light.

Lord I come to your awesome presence
From the shadows into your radiance
By the blood I may enter your brightness
Search me, try me, consume all my darkness
Shine on me (2).
```
