# As the deer
```
As the deer panteth for the water,
So my soul longeth after Thee.
You alone are my heart's desire,
And I long to worship you.

You alone are my Strength, my shield,
To you alone may my spirit yield.
You alone are my heart's desire,
And I long to worship you.

I want you more than Gold and silver,
Only you can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy-giver,
And the apple of my eye.

You're my friend and you are my brother,
Even though you are my Lord
I love you more than any other,
So much more than anything.
```
`Psalms`
