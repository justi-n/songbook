# In his time
```
In his time, In his time,
He makes all things beautiful in his time,
Lord, please show me everyday
As you're teaching me your way
That you do just what you say.

In your time, In your time,
He makes all things beautiful in your time,
Lord, my life to you bring
With its winter and its spring
May I fathom everything in your time.

There's a time, There's a time,
Both for sowing and for reaping there's a time
Time for losing, time for gain
Time for joy and time for pain
Every purpose under heaven has a time.

There are times, there are days
Weeks and months we cannot understand God's ways.
If for years we fail to scan
What is his eternal plan
We'll remember what he can all the time.
Whom shall I send?
