# Make me a channel of your peace
```
Make me a channel of your peace,
Where there is hatred let me bring your love.
Where there is injury your pardon Lord
And where there's doubt true faith in You.

Oh Master grant that I may never seek.
So much to be consoled as to console,
To be understood as to understand,
To be loved as to love with all my soul.

Make me a channel of your peace
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope.
Where there is darkness, Lord your shining light.
And where there's sadness, every joy.

Make me a channel of your peace,
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
In giving to all men that we receive,
And in dying that we're born to eternal life
