# All to Jesus I surrender
```
All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence daily live.

I surrender all, I surrender all
All to thee, my blessed Saviour
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Humbly at His feet I bow
Worldly pleasure all forsaken
Take me Jesus, take me now.

All to Jesus I surrender
Make me Saviour wholly Thine
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit
Truly know that Thou art mine.

All to Jesus I surrender
Now I feel the sacred flame
O the joy of full salvation
Glory, glory to His name.
