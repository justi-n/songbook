# Great indeed are your works O lord
```
Great indeed are your works O lord
now and evermore
Great indeed are your works O lord
now and evermore

The universe night and day
Tells of all your wonders
You are our life and our light
We shall praise you always
You are the path which we tread
you will lead us onward

From every corner of the Earth
All the nations gather
You lead us all by the hand
To the heavenly kingdom
Then at the end of all time
You will come in glory.
```
`Psalms`
